        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 17, 2025</p>

        <p>
            Thank you for playing "Stacks are High!". Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with our game.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            By downloading and playing our game, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>
            We want to be crystal clear: <strong>We do not personally collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from you.</strong> This includes your name, email address, physical address, phone number, photos, or any other data that could directly identify you. We do not have servers that store this type of information.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Collected by Our Partners (Third-Party Services)</h2>
        <p>
            While we don't collect your personal data, our game uses third-party services that are essential for its operation and improvement. These services may collect their own data under their own privacy policies.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            To make "Stacks are High!" better, we use an analytics tool to understand how players interact with the game. This service collects anonymous, non-personal data, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How long you play (session length).</li>
            <li>Game progress (e.g., levels completed, high scores).</li>
            <li>In-game events (e.g., features used, buttons clicked).</li>
            <li>General device information (e.g., device model, operating system).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This data is aggregated and completely anonymous. It helps us fix bugs, balance gameplay, and improve the overall player experience. We cannot identify you from this data.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Advertising (Monetization)</h3>
        <p>
            Our game is supported by ads, which are provided by third-party ad networks like <strong>Unity Ads</strong>. In order to show you relevant advertisements, these networks may collect certain information, which can include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device identifiers (e.g., IDFA for iOS, Google Ad ID for Android).</li>
            <li>Your IP address to estimate your general location (e.g., country).</li>
            <li>Device information (e.g., language, OS version).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This data helps them serve ads that are more likely to be of interest to you. We do not have access to or control over the data they collect. We encourage you to review their privacy policy to understand how they handle your data.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unity Ads Privacy Policy:</strong> <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Required Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            "Stacks are High!" requires the <strong>INTERNET</strong> permission on your device. This is necessary for the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To allow our third-party analytics service to send anonymous gameplay data.</li>
            <li>To allow our third-party ad network to download and display advertisements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The game cannot function as intended without this permission.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

If you believe we might have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly address the issue.
        </p>
